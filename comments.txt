Things to do


1. IDAL methods (see 2 & 3)
2. Running numbers [this is part of some of the methods so make sure to watch relevant video first]
3. check out eg in GIT for CRUD Methods
4. watch sat night video for tomorrow

ADD LISTS TO DATASOURCE 
implement the exceptions
add erased field for the bus, busstop, busline
do we have busRouteStop? in DO  (contains line no, a station, and its number in the route)


/// Notes By GILA:

- I changed the LineStation id, station code and key to be of type int --- do we need an entity key specified? or shoudl i use that instead? see DLObjects
- I added the Cloning exstention method + the DataSource lists (one for each class - not sure if we need all but i suppose we will see)
