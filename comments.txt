Hi, lets take a fresh start!

//Gila:
// I made the following changes:

DO.BusLine - removed the leaving property it was unnecessary
DO.Staff - added properties LoginPassword; StaffPostion; StaffYrsWorked

//I added:
In the BLApi I added the classes ScheduleOfRoute and ComapanySchedule with their necessary properties
- the idea is that BusRoute forms the complete route; ScheduleOFRoute adds the timing of start and end time of the route and how many times the rout runs in a day; 
and then CompanySchedule is an IEnumerable list of all the Schedules of all the routes defined in the company.

- added the class StationWithRoutes this is supposed to simulate the papers by busstops that show what routes pass through this busStop



To ask Esther: Thank you so much for your help :) We really appreciate it! [further praises to follow...] 
(1) our program crashes becuase there is an issue (we think) with the bin and files and properties etc
(2) Where do we put our methods???
(3) IEnumerabble<>???????? aka delegates aka passing from DO to BO
(4) Succsive stations  & BusOnRoute are both relevant to being on a trip AKA as a user....what are they intended for

//ELEORA
dl object rewrite the exceptions [DONE]
user shouldn't be able to set the status of the bus (must be available when added to the busList)
IEnumerable GetListWithSelectedFields

//GILA
xml files :) 


IMPORTANT THINGS TO LOOK UP AND LEARN HOW TO DO
- xml files {GILA} 
- BLIMP {ELEORA}
- each read stage 2 of project {BOTH}

//ask esther:
- BL FACTORY
- Get item given a certain file ... IEnumerable<>(<func,object> generate )..??? 
- Decrypting

//Eleora's late comments 
-We shoudln't be able to CRUD from bus schedule (only from company schedule). Company Schedule goes in the PL as an observable collection?

-Eveytime we create a busStop we see if it already exists in StationInRoute collection , if yes we add the line to the list of line of the collection,
if no we create a new object and add it to the list. List of stations in the PL.



///addition of running numbers?
