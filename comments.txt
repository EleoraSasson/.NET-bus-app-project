Hi, lets take a fresh start!

//Gila:
// I made the following changes:

DO.BusLine - removed the leaving property it was unnecessary
DO.Staff - added properties LoginPassword; StaffPostion; StaffYrsWorked

//I added:
In the BLApi I added the classes ScheduleOfRoute and ComapanySchedule with their necessary properties
- the idea is that BusRoute forms the complete route; ScheduleOFRoute adds the timing of start and end time of the route and how many times the rout runs in a day; 
and then CompanySchedule is an IEnumerable list of all the Schedules of all the routes defined in the company.

- added the class StationWithRoutes this is supposed to simulate the papers by busstops that show what routes pass through this busStop
