"Just because you cannot do everything, does not mean you cannot do something! - Rabbi Altman"
Every bit we do, do counts! Kol Hakavod!! :) 


NB THINGS TO FIX IN PLCONSOLE
- IEnumerable does not print out all the in=tems in the get functions :(
- The update funstion for the BusRoute doesn't work :(
- when adding stations to a line it should change the start and end stop if the BusLine Properties (ideally)


Additional Notes:
- add decrypting
- look up func<> delegates or something
