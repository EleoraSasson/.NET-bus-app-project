Things to do


1. IDAL methods (see 2 & 3)
2. Running numbers [this is part of some of the methods so make sure to watch relevant video first]
3. check out eg in GIT for CRUD Methods
4. watch sat night video for tomorrow

/// Notes by Eleora:

ADD LISTS TO DATASOURCE 
implement the exceptions
add erased field for the bus, busstop, busline
do we have busRouteStop? in DO  (contains line no, a station, and its number in the route)


/// Notes By GILA:

- I changed the LineStation id, station code and key to be of type int --- do we need an entity key specified? or shoudl i use that instead? see DLObjects
- I added the Cloning exstention method + the DataSource lists (one for each class - not sure if we need all but i suppose we will see)

OUR SYSTEM NEEDS TOO:
- Display Buses 
	- allow to send a bus for refuel/maintenance 
	- display details of individual buses
	- add remove or update info
- Display of Bus Lines 
	- bus route stops consecutively
 	- add or updte and delete bus line info/route stops
- Display of Bus Stops 
	- display info of a single bus stop
	- include lines through that stop
	- update travel distance between 2 stops
	- add remove update info

BL LAYER  --> BLObjects in our BLApi (what classes are we adding that the PL layer will want)
- bus line information
- bus stop information

Some more things to do... :) [you know cause we are sooo bored]

[make sure to finish IDAL implementations in DLObject...]
1. Write the exceptions specific to your IDAL implementations in the ExceptionHandling class (currently in DLObject)
2. watch rest of recording about BL layer
